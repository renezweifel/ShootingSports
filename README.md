# ShootingSports
Here starts a hobby project of myself. I am in a shooting community in Switzerland and fight all day long with deprecated and outdated software for shooting ranges.
The goal is to build a dynamic solution where we have different modules for managing communities, users, shooting ranges and all the events during the shooting season.
More informations soon (hopefully ;)).
